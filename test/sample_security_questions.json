    "id": "question_4",
    "text": "How does the organization manage and monitor privileged access across systems?",
    "expected_answer": "Privileged access follows least privilege principles with manager-approved requests. Access is reviewed quarterly and during role changes. All privileged activities are logged and monitored in real-time with monthly audits. Alerts trigger for unusual behavior, and admin sessions are recorded and retained for 90 days."

    "text": "What encryption controls are in place to protect data throughout its lifecycle?",
    "expected_answer": "Data is classified (public, internal, confidential, restricted) with appropriate handling requirements. All network transmission uses TLS 1.2+ or IPSec VPN. Data at rest is protected through database encryption, full-disk encryption on file servers, and BitLocker on endpoints. Keys are managed through a centralized system."

    "id": "question_6",
    "text": "What processes ensure vulnerabilities are identified and remediated in a timely manner?",
    "expected_answer": "Monthly vulnerability scans are performed on production systems and weekly on internet-facing systems. Critical patches are applied within 7 days, high-severity within 30 days. Annual third-party penetration tests cover external, internal, and application security. Findings are tracked in a vulnerability management system with severity-based due dates, monthly progress reviews, and verification scans."
